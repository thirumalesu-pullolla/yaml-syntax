Comments and Special Characters
🔹 1. Comments in YAML
Use the # symbol for comments.

Anything after # on the same line is ignored.
 
# This is a comment
name: Alice  # Inline comment
age: 25
📝 Note:

YAML doesn't support multi-line comments.

Keep comments outside the value unless inline.

🔹 2. Special Characters in YAML Strings
Sometimes, you need to wrap a string in quotes to handle special characters or avoid parsing errors.

🟡 a. Double Quotes (" ")  

Allows escaping (\n, \t, etc.)

Useful when the string contains :, #, \, or quotes.
 
quote: "She said, \"YAML is awesome!\""
path: "C:\\Users\\Alice"

🟡 b. Single Quotes (' ')

Everything is treated literally.

No escaping required inside.
 
sentence: 'Don\'t panic!'
💡 Tip: Use single quotes when your string contains double quotes, and vice versa.

🔹 3. Strings Starting with Special Characters

Use quotes if your string starts with special characters like @, #, {, [, :, -

handle: "@alice"
topic: "#devtalks"
emoji: ":smile:"
