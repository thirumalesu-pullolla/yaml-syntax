YAML Anchors (&), Aliases (*), and Merging (<<)

&anchor: Give a name to a block of data.

*alias: Reuse the data where the anchor was defined.

<< merge key: Merge all key-value pairs from the anchor.

Simple example 1 ::

default_user: &user
  name: Alice
  age: 25
  role: user

admin_user:
  <<: *user
  role: admin
ðŸ’¡ Explanation:
&user â€” defines an anchor for default_user

*user â€” alias refers to that anchor

<<: *user â€” merges the key-values from default_user into admin_user

role is overridden in admin_user

example 2 ::

defaults: &defaults
  theme: dark
  notifications: true
  layout: grid

user1:
  <<: *defaults
  theme: light

user2:
  <<: *defaults
ðŸ’¡ Output Understanding:
user1 inherits everything from defaults, but changes theme to light.

user2 inherits all settings exactly as they are in defaults.

Important Notes:

You can only define one anchor per section.

Aliases use the same indentation level as the content they're replacing.

<< is only used to merge a map (i.e., key-value pairs), not lists.
