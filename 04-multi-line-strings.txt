YAML supports multi-line strings in two main styles:

ğŸ”¹ 1. Literal Style (|)

Preserves line breaks

Good for code blocks, messages, etc.

 
description: |
  This is a multi-line description.
  All line breaks
  will be preserved exactly as written.

ğŸŸ¢ Output (in memory or when parsed):

This is a multi-line description.
All line breaks
will be preserved exactly as written.

ğŸ”¹ 2. Folded Style (>)

Converts newlines to spaces

Useful for long sentences across lines

summary: >
  This is a folded style string.
  Newlines will be replaced with spaces
  when parsed.

ğŸŸ¢ Output:
 
This is a folded style string. Newlines will be replaced with spaces when parsed.
